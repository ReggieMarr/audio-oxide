    Sends UDP packets to ESP8266 to update LED strip values

    The ESP8266 will receive and decode the packets to determine what values
    to display on the LED strip. The communication protocol supports LED strips
    with a maximum of 256 LEDs.

    The packet encoding scheme is:
        |i|r|g|b|
    where
        i (0 to 255): Index of LED to change (zero-based)
        r (0 to 255): Red value of LED
        g (0 to 255): Green value of LED
        b (0 to 255): Blue value of LED
